what did you do with my sister
he had never seen anything like it
there was no one in the aisle
he can be a lot of good
there was only one thing to do
do you want to come with mommy
a serious look came over his face
i am deeply in love with you
i would have done anything for him
i was going to go there myself
i thought it was a strange comment
i have to get out of here
is that what you want to hear
it was disturbing to say the least
do you think you can do it
i can handle it on my own
i had no choice in the matter
i want her out of the picture
she folded her arms over her chest
i knew it would work for him
somebody got him a glass of water
i read about it in the papers
i just want to be in love
he was also a very good listener
he had apparently waited around too long
is there anything else you would like
what do you want to talk about
he knew what was going to happen
i would sneak out of the room
are you going to talk to her
religion was never made to be fun
it would have been fine with me
why do you have to do this
are they really going to do it
but no one would ever know that
what else did you do with him
she seemed to be deep in thought
she was like one of the guys
where are we going to put her
i was starting to feel more confident
no one could ever take his place
i am also very proud of them
there would be no saving the house
i felt so dreadfully out of place
we just want to talk to you
they were really very kind to me
she then ran out of the house
it had been one drama after another
he had come far in one day
i asked her if she loved him
they said he would never walk again
she said it had gone very well
it gets very hot in the morning
i just knew i had to run
he was moving up in every way
people began to smile at one another
i thought you might like a challenge
come on get out of my house
he sat quietly for a few moments
he could have prevented it from happening
he made a note of his finding
she knows how to hold a grudge
i had another reason to be worried
it would be perfect for your kids
it was just as well i did
what do i think should be done
he had no such guarantees to give
how can i get past the pain
there was a robot in the corner
it looked like a pretty good spot
do you know what it looks like
you have no reason to be afraid
there was no clear reason for that
i have no way to judge that
there could be no doubt about it
he got up and opened the door
i need to get on with this
there was work left to be done
i have no idea what just happened
this will take me a few minutes
he would have to think of it
there was no reason to notice it
she was not supposed to say this
how dare you say such a thing
how am i going to see that
all eyes turned to look at him
that is all there is to do
how did they get started on this
it had not been going on long
he would have to think it through
why did you want to find me
how did you get involved with them
she seemed to be in a trance
i waited for you to come home
why would he want to see me
the world had come to an end
what if we talk in the morning
there was an uproar in the room
we might as well go for lunch
now there was laughter in the room
do you know where it came from
i want to go for a walk
why do you make fun of me
he used to be in the army
stall him as long as you can
she must have been waiting behind it
what else do i have to do
we have more important things to do
do you think i can hide it
why does it have to be you
she never believed that for a second
thank you so much for the drink
i do not like it at all
it was nothing to do with me
it was time to go to work
that was not a lot of time
what is the meaning of conscious existence
he sat up and stared at her
i have no time for that now
he took in a lot of smoke
do you want to wait with us
she does not know how to answer
he ran his hands through his hair
he decides not to think about that
what are you really up to here
i think he was playing with them
so we meet for the first time
who else would take care of them
it was a busy day for him
how did you explain this to people
surely she can do better than this
why is she asking us to dinner
her eyes showed no comprehension at all
it seemed to be enough for them
i can feel sorry for him now
how much time until we get there
he is very good to us remember
they are not listening to us now
she bends to look on the floor
i think we just saw something important
you might want to look at this
we are here to practice life skills
this was a lot to take in
do you mind if i record this
he did not want to be late
they sat in silence for a while
i could see he was very sick
it was too ridiculous to take seriously
there are two men in the picture
he did not take it from me
do you think it could be true 
she was going to miss that boy
he opened his eyes a little wider
you want to go get a coffee
how did i make you do that
how do you know which it is
i was very excited at seeing him
i want to have sex with you
people thought cocaine was good for you
i will meet you at the house
i do not want to hear this
she will not need to do that
i would like to see your father
i would like to speak to you
i will see you at the restaurant
you do not need to tell me
i will be along in a moment
but that does not work on me
i do not need to meet her
i will get it some other time
i think it is a silly idea
i will have to tell him now
do not tell me to be quiet
i did not mean to hurt her
i do not want to be involved
do you think it is all right
i wonder what he is doing here
it is a rare thing to love
i do not think he trusted him
they do not know about him yet
i will have to operate at once
i thought i would take a walk
i could not do such a thing
i am on time like i said
of course he could not hear me
you are going to make me laugh
i would like to hear about it
you have got to keep it up
i do not trust you that much
you do not seem to enjoy it
i will always remember what he said
i do not trust you a bit
that is all he had to do
then you will come back for me
i am too smart to be fooled
i am not giving up hope yet
i knew he would not fail us
let us have a drink over there
i will ask one of the guys
there is nothing wrong with being scared
